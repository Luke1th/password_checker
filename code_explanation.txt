The code is a **password security checker** that evaluates the security of passwords provided as command-line arguments. It performs two main checks: 

1. **Local common password check**: Verifies if the password exists in a local file (`common_passwords.txt`) containing a list of commonly used passwords.
2. **HIBP API check**: Uses the "Have I Been Pwned" (HIBP) API to check if the password has been exposed in known data breaches.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how your code works:

---

### **1. Importing Required Modules**
```python
import requests      
import hashlib        
import sys
```
- `requests`: For making HTTP requests to the HIBP API.
- `hashlib`: For hashing passwords using SHA-1 (required by the HIBP API).
- `sys`: For handling command-line arguments and exiting with appropriate status codes.

---

### **2. HIBP API Integration**
#### `request_api_data(query_char)`
- Sends a request to the HIBP API with the first 5 characters of the SHA-1 hash of the password.
- Returns the response containing a list of hash suffixes and their breach counts.

#### `get_password_leaks_count(hashes, hash_to_check)`
- Parses the API response to find if the full hash of the password exists in the breach data.
- Returns the number of times the password was found in breaches.

#### `pwned_api_check(password)`
- Hashes the password using SHA-1 and splits it into the first 5 characters (`first5_char`) and the rest (`tail`).
- Sends the first 5 characters to the API and checks if the `tail` exists in the response.
- Returns the breach count if found, or `0` if not.

---

### **3. Local Common Password Check**
#### `check_common_password(password)`
- Opens the common_passwords.txt file and loads its contents into a `set` for fast lookups.
- Checks if the password exists in the set.
- Handles errors like missing or unreadable files gracefully by printing warnings and skipping the check.

---

### **4. Main Function**
#### `main(args)`
- Accepts a list of passwords as command-line arguments.
- Prints a structured table header for the results.
- For each password:
  1. **Strips whitespace** to ensure clean input.
  2. **Checks the local common password list**:
     - If found, marks the password as "Common password" and advises changing it.
  3. **Checks the HIBP API**:
     - If found in breaches, marks the password as "Data breach" and displays the breach count.
  4. If neither check finds the password, marks it as "Secure password."
- Prints the results in a formatted table.
- Returns `0` for success or `1` if no passwords were provided.

---

### **5. Entry Point**
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    sys.exit(main(sys.argv[1:]))
```
- Executes the `main` function with command-line arguments (excluding the script name).
- Exits with the appropriate status code.

---

### **Example Execution**
Command:
```bash
python passcheck.py password123 qwerty mysecurepassword
```

Output:
```
Password             | Status          | Details
------------------------------------------------------------
password123          | Common password | Found in common_passwords list. Consider changing it!

qwerty               | Common password | Found in common_passwords list. Consider changing it!

mysecurepassword     | Secure password | Not found in breach or common_passwords list.
```

---

### **Key Features**
1. **Local and API-based checks**: Combines local file checks with an online API for comprehensive password evaluation.
2. **Error handling**: Gracefully handles missing files or API errors.
3. **User-friendly output**: Displays results in a structured table format.

---

### **Potential Improvements**
1. **Rate-limiting for API requests**: Add a delay between API calls to avoid being blocked.
2. **Password masking**: Avoid printing passwords directly in the output for privacy.
3. **Parallel API requests**: Use threading or asynchronous requests to speed up API checks for multiple passwords.
4. **Customizable common password file**: Allow users to specify a custom file path for common_passwords.txt.
