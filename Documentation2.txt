The script is designed to check if passwords have been exposed in data breaches and 
whether they are part of a list of commonly used passwords. 
It uses the Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) API for breach data and checks local files for common passwords. 
This Python script evaluates the security of passwords by checking against two sources: 
a local list containing 1000 passwords generated by ChatGPT and an external API known as HIBP (Have I Been Pwned). 

This is how it works:

1. **Functionality**:
   - The script processes each password provided as an argument.
   - It first checks if the password is in a locally stored file of common_passwords.txt
   - If not found in the local list, it queries HIBP using the first 5 characters of the SHA-1 hash of the password.
   
2. **API Integration**:
   - The script uses the `requests` library to make HTTP requests to the HIBP API.
   - It constructs a URL based on the first 5 characters of the hashed password and retrieves the response.

3. **Hashing**:
   - Passwords are converted into SHA-1 hashes using `hashlib`.
   - The first 5 characters of the hash are used to query the HIBP API, while the remaining part is checked against known breach data.

4. **Output**:
   - For each password, the script outputs whether it's a common password or has been involved in a data breach.
   - The results are formatted in a structured manner for clarity.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - The script includes error handling for cases where the local file is missing or unreadable, 
   providing informative messages to the user.

1. Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) API: This API provides a list of breached passwords, 
which are hashed using SHA-1 and stored in a database.
2. A local common password list (`common_passwords.txt`): 
This file contains a list of common passwords that should be avoided.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

**Importing libraries**
The script starts by importing three libraries:

* `requests`: for making HTTP requests to the HIBP API
* `hashlib`: for hashing passwords using SHA-1
* `sys`: for accessing command-line arguments

**Functions**
The script defines four functions:

### 1. `request_api_data(query_char)`
This function sends a GET request to the HIBP API with the first five characters 
of the password's SHA-1 hash as a query parameter (`query_char`). It returns the response object.

### 2. `get_password_leaks_count(hashes, hash_to_check)`
This function takes two parameters:

* `hashes`: the response text from the HIBP API ( split into lines)
* `hash_to_check`: the remaining five characters of the password's SHA-1 hash

It iterates over the lines in `hashes` and checks if the second part (`h`) matches the `hash_to_check`. 
If a match is found, it returns the corresponding count. Otherwise, it returns 0.

### 3. `pwned_api_check(password)`
This function takes a password as input and:

1. Hashes the password using SHA-1
2. Extracts the first five characters (`first5_char`) and the remaining five characters (`tail`)
3. Calls `request_api_data` with `first5_char`
4. Calls `get_password_leaks_count` with the response from HIBP API and `tail`

The function returns the count of password breaches found.

### 4. `check_common_password(password)`
This function checks if a password is in the local common password list (`common-password.txt`). 
If the file is not found or cannot be read, it skips the check and returns False.

**Main function**
The main function takes command-line arguments as input (passwords to check). It:

1. Prints a header with column names
2. Iterates over each password:
	* Checks if the password is in the local common password list
	* If not, checks the HIBP API using `pwned_api_check`
3. Prints the result for each password with an extra newline at the end

**Entry point**
The script uses the `if __name__ == '__main__':` guard to ensure that the main function 
is only executed when the script is run directly (not imported as a module).

When run, the script expects one or more passwords as command-line arguments. 
If no arguments are provided, it prints an error message and exits with a non-zero status code.

Example usage:
```bash
python pwned_passwords.py password123 commonpass
```
This would check if `password123` and `commonpass` have been compromised in 
any data breaches or are in the local common password list.


Potential Enhancements:
- Hash Prefix : Using a longer hash prefix might improve uniqueness in identifying compromised passwords.
- Error Handling : Adding more detailed logging or user-friendly messages for errors like missing files.
- Rate Limiting : Implementing rate limiting to avoid overwhelming the HIBP API with excessive queries.
- Output Formatting : Allowing customization of output format for better readability.

Conclusion:

This Python script is designed to evaluate the security of passwords by checking against two sources: 
a local list of 1000 common passwords generated by ChatGPT and an external API known as HIBP (Have I Been Pwned). 
The script is a useful tool for quickly assessing the security of passwords by combining checks against common passwords and known breach data. 
It's particularly helpful for users who want to ensure their credentials are strong and have not been involved in past breaches.
